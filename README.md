Classifying White Blood Cells with CNNs
I found a WBC classification neural network developed by dhruvp in github. We would dive into the code and try to improve it. By adding simple dropouts inside the model I could achieve far smoother lines for variation loss and accuracies, while maintaining the accuracy score of 98.59+% on test data.
Also the validation accuracy in my version remains greater than the training accuracy, which means we donâ€™t overfit.
